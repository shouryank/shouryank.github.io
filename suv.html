        <h2>About SUVs:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A Sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a car classification that combine elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.</li>
          <li>Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV.</li>
          <li>A crossover SUV is defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as per passenger cars), however in many cases crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs.</li>
          <li>Automotive websites descriptions of SUVs range from specifically "combining car-like appointments and wagon practicality with steadfast off-road capability" with "chair-height seats and picture-window visibility" to the more general "nearly anything with available all-wheel drive and raised ground clearance". It is also suggested that the term SUV has replaced "jeep" as a general term for off-road vehicle.</li>
          <li>Large vehicle that is designed to be used on rough surfaces but that is often used on city roads or highways</li>
          <li>Passenger vehicle similar to a station wagon but with the chassis of a small truck and, usually, four-wheel drive</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For whom is SUVs?</h2>
        <p>
          The main reason why people buy SUVs or you are currently looking into it as an option for you to buy are:
          <ul>
            <li>Lenient on budget</li>
            <li>Want maximum luxury for the money spent</li>
            <li>Carzy offroading</li>
            <li>Not scared of the vehicle getting hit by the road humps and sail smoothly through the pothols</li>
            <li>For a family of 4 to 8</li>
            <li>Inter city and long distance travel is very comfortable unlike hatchbacks or sedans</li>
            <li>Powerful engine to take care of anything</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Things to be checked before buying:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Leg and head room : Check if your head is touching the roof or your knees touching the seat in front of you or the steering wheel or dashboard</li>
          <li>Steerinng comfort : Check if the steering is light enough to be manueverable in the tight traffics and easy to take u turns (turning radius of the wheels)</li>
          <li>Length of vehicle : Check if it fits in your parking space and check if you can get through on of those tight roads. Good for long distance travels (luxury) but city traffic? Do you really need a long vehicle to get yourself to office and back everyday? (go for hatchbacks instead)</li>
          <li>Infotainment system : To get yourself a peace of mind through the traffic and reach your destination peacefully you should go for it. Get yourselves equipped with the best of speakers.</li>
          <li>Rear camera : If you park everyday in a tight parking space this is going to be handy. Otherwise also very handy to get through tight roads (360 degree camera) or to get your life easy with manuevering it.</li>
          <li>Hill Hold control and Hill descent control : Handy to pull up and get down something in a 2 to 3 ton SUv.</li>
          <li>Airbags : Make sure you get the maximum number of airbags to get yourself and your family a safe journey.</li>
          <li>ABS (Anti-lock Breaking system) and ESP or ESC (Electronic stability program/control) : Helpful in times of wet roads and losing control of the vehicle/.</li>
          <li>Transmission (optional but actually a mandate when buying an almost 5m long vehicle) : Go for amt or cvt or any other alternative if your budget permits. It will make your life way simpler compared to manual transmission.</li>
          <li>Clutch comfort (optional) : Check if the clutch is hard and the travel it takes to get the clutch to full</li>
          <li>Sunroof (optional) : A long drive at the night or to feel more airy in thr cabin in day time or to get that breeze flow throught your hair, this is just the thinng you need.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is just some of the basics. Make sure to go through the features list once and check if it ticks all your needs or most of your needs.</p>
